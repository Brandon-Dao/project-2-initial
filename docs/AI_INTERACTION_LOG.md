# AI Interaction Log

This document serves as a log of interactions with AI systems, capturing prompts, responses, and reflections on the outcomes. It is intended to help users track their engagements with AI and improve future interactions.

## Driver
Step 4: Advanced Driver Class
Create a sophisticated ShapeDriver.java that demonstrates:
* Polymorphism: Array/List of Shape3D references holding different shapes
* Comparative Analysis: Which shape has the largest volume for given constraints?
* Interactive Features: Allow user to create shapes with custom parameters
* Performance Timing: Measure calculation speeds (optional)
* Formatted Output: Professional presentation of results
  Sample Output Format:

=== 3D Shape Analysis System ===

Created Shapes:
1. Sphere {name='Red Ball', radius=5.0}
    - Surface Area: 314.16 square units
    - Volume: 523.60 cubic units

2. Cube {name='Blue Box', side=4.0}
    - Surface Area: 96.00 square units
    - Volume: 64.00 cubic units

[... other shapes ...]

Analysis Results:
- Largest Volume: Red Ball (523.60)
- Largest Surface Area: Red Ball (314.16)
- Most Efficient (Volume/Surface): Blue Box (0.67)
## Class 1
Step 1: Generate the Abstract Base Class
Must Include:
* Implements the ThreeDimensionalShape interface
* Concrete implementations of getVolume() and getSurfaceArea() that call the abstract methods
* Common properties: name (String), color (String) (Properties in Java are typically private fields with public getters and setters)
* Constructor(s) for initialization
* toString() method that formats output consistently
* Getter/setter methods as appropriate

Step 2: Create Five Concrete Shape Classes
1. Sphere - Properties: radius
2. Cube - Properties: sideLength
3. Cylinder - Properties: radius, height
4. RectangularPrism - Properties: length, width, height
5. Pyramid
   For Each Shape Class:
    * Extends Shape3D (which implements ThreeDimensionalShape)
    * Implement the abstract calculation methods from Shape3D
    * Include proper constructors with validation
    * Override toString() with shape-specific formatting
    * Add any shape-specific methods if needed
      Documentation Requirement: Each class must include this comment header:

## Class 2
Comprehensive Unit Testing
For each shape class, generate JUnit 5 test classes that include:
**Test Categories:**
* **Basic Functionality**: Constructor, getters, setters
* **Calculation Accuracy**: Volume and surface area with known values
* **Boundary Testing**: Zero values, very small/large numbers
* **Input Validation**: Negative values, null inputs
* **Inheritance Testing**: Polymorphic behavior verification
